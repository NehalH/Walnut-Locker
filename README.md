# Walnut Locker ðŸŒ°ðŸ”’
A file/application locker that controls user access for applications, files, and directories by leveraging the Operating System.

## Description
This project is a desktop application that provides advanced file and application protection through the use of the operating system's user permission restrictions and dynamic passwords. It offers a unique solution for securing important files and applications, as it leverages the capabilities of the operating system to enforce protection via access modes. This sets it apart from other third-party security applications whose security can be breached simply by removing/uninstallig the software.
